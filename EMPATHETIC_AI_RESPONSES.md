```

### Example 2: User is Angry

```

### After (Correct):
```
User: Sad → AI: Calm  ✅ Supportive & comforting
User: Angry → AI: Calm  ✅ De-escalating & understanding
User: Confused → AI: Calm  ✅ Helpful & clarifying
User: Happy → AI: Happy  ✅ Shares positive emotions
```

```

### Scenario 2: Frustration Help
